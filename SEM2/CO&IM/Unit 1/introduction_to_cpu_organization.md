# Introduction to CPU Organization

This section provides an overview of CPU organization, setting the stage for understanding the more detailed topics in this unit.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
*   **Organization:** Refers to the internal structure and functional units of the CPU and how they are interconnected and interact to perform their tasks.
*   **Microprocessor (like 8085):** A single integrated circuit that contains the entire CPU.

**Unit 1 Overview (From the Presentation):**

The presentation "UNIT 1 : CPU ORGANIZATION" by Prof. Shankar Mali will cover the following key aspects:

*   **Bus Organization:** How different components within a computer system communicate with each other, focusing on the 8085 microprocessor as an example.
*   **Computer Components:**  Understanding the fundamental building blocks of a computer system, including the CPU, memory, and input/output (I/O) modules.
*   **Computer Function:**  Explaining the basic steps involved in executing a program, including the instruction cycle.
*   **Interrupts:** How the CPU handles external events and interruptions to its normal program execution.
*   **Stack-Based CPU Organization:**  Exploring a different CPU architecture that utilizes a stack for operations.
*   **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):**  Delving into the component responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.
*   **Addressing Modes:**  Examining different ways the CPU can access data and instructions in memory.

**Why Study CPU Organization?**

Understanding CPU organization is crucial because it:

*   Provides a foundational knowledge of how computers work at a low level.
*   Helps in understanding performance bottlenecks and optimizing code.
*   Is essential for anyone working in computer architecture, embedded systems, operating systems, and related fields.
*   Gives insights into the evolution of computer technology and the principles behind modern processors.

This unit will start by exploring the bus organization of the 8085 microprocessor, a classic example for understanding fundamental CPU concepts.
